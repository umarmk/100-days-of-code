# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 27, 2026 

Today I worked with modules in Python. I went through the sys, random, factorial, and platform module. I learnt how to use dir() and built a simple generate_lottery tickets function.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
